# form

This is a registration form made for fictitious streaming-service.
Made using HTML and css, after prototype made in figma.

This is my first student asignment,where the focuse lies in practicing making
structured workprosesses, from planning and building a prototype to making a
structurend and clean codebase, besides making responsiv design.

The codebase itself, i`ve used semantic elements and BEM system. 
I use BEM because it makes the code organized and easy to read for other
developers and make it easyer to style the html element. 
I use semantic blocks to improve accessibility and provide to users and search engines.

I have used media queries and flexbox to make responsiv design, 
the webpage will render in diffrent sized screens.
